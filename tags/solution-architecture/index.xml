      <description>This page documents the steps I undertook to automate the daily data ingestion in a database we use on daily basis (Postgres in RDS). It can serve as a template for future application containerization. While this may be trivial for the DevOps team, it is certainly a bit outside of the usual data science skill set. While it is not uncommon for data scientists to run things via docker when they need completely isolated things, the Fargate part is something most data scientist will not touch in the usual workflow.</description>
