      <description>It is often important to accept incoming data at regular interval and then update the data warehouse with these new data. A cron job is perfect for this kind of task. I have recently worked to achieve such a task using Google cloud platform and did not want to spin up a single compute engine instance just for this purpose. That would be a complete waste of resource. The other viable alternative is to use a Google App Engine instance and configure a cron job.</description>
