      <description>Imagine doing a sentiment analysis on an ongoing event based on realtime Twitter feed. Twitter will give you a lot of tweets, and you can use R, Python or any other language to collect them. But what happens if you want to do that for a really long time with running a R/Python function in the background i.e. how do you handle streaming? The open source world has provided us with a couple of alternatives which can handle terabytes of streaming data.</description>

      <description>Gantt chart can be very useful to visualize the occurance of certain events on a timeline. If you need create one programmetically, you can use gvis package which utilizes plotting library from Google.
